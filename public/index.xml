      <description>Oregon data is sometimes zero because our health department is slow updating their website.
Want even more data? Go expand the tables with the little + symbols at the Oregon Health Authority.</description>

      <description>I got tired of reading the news every day to find out how many new cases we had today. The other dashboards required me to do math, and they were overwhelming to look at every day. So, this is just a print of the new cases by state and in the US. If folks are interested, I might add other countries.
Built from:
 Covid Tracking API You can get the code for this dashboard or contribute on GitHub.</description>

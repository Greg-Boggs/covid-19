I got tired of reading the news every day to find out how many new cases we had today. The other dashboards required me to do math, and they were overwhelming to look at every day. So, this is just a print of the new cases by state and in the US. If folks are interested, I might add other countries.

Built from:

* [Covid Tracking API](https://covidtracking.com/)
* You can get the code for this dashboard or contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/greg-boggs/covid-19).
* You can hire me or find out about me at [my website](https://gregboggs.com/)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/greg-boggs/covid-19/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregory_boggs).

Thanks for reading!
